Yet another Cornell Box. I have optimised the code of my shader "RIOW 2.07: Instances"
for the Cornell Box and added direct light sampling to reduce noise. Only Lambertian
solid materials and cubes are supported.

These shaders are my implementation of the raytracer described in the (excellent)
book "Ray tracing in one weekend" and "Ray tracing: the next week"[1] by Peter Shirley
(@Peter_shirley).
